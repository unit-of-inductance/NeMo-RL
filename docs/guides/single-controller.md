# Train with Single-Controller (Async GRPO and PPO)

:::{warning}
The Single-Controller path is a **beta feature** and still under active development. The API and configuration surface are not yet stable and may change without notice. Issues and feedback are welcome — please file them at [github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/issues](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/issues).
:::

The Single-Controller (SC) path is an alternative async GRPO and PPO runtime that runs rollout generation and policy training as two independent *pumps* coordinated by a single Ray actor (`SingleControllerActor`) sitting over a shared TransferQueue (TQ) data plane. Compared to the legacy async GRPO in [async-grpo.md](./async-grpo.md), SC decouples per-prompt rollouts from the per-step batch boundary: producers push finished rollouts into `TQReplayBuffer` at group granularity, and a pluggable `StalenessSampler` decides which groups the trainer consumes on each step.

## Configure the Single-Controller Path

The SC path is launched via a dedicated entrypoint:

```bash
uv run examples/run_grpo_single_controller.py --config <your-sc.yaml>
```

`run_grpo_single_controller.py` mirrors `run_grpo.py` for config loading — the same YAML files apply — but requires a few settings the legacy path does not. The default exemplar lives at [examples/configs/grpo_math_1B_megatron_single_controller.yaml](../../examples/configs/grpo_math_1B_megatron_single_controller.yaml); the PPO one at [examples/configs/ppo_math_1B_megatron_single_controller.yaml](../../examples/configs/ppo_math_1B_megatron_single_controller.yaml).

### Mandatory settings

1. **Enable the TransferQueue data plane** (required — the entrypoint refuses to start otherwise):

    ```yaml
    data_plane:
      enabled: true
    ```

2. **Pick a generation backend**. With vLLM, **disable colocated inference** (setup rejects `colocated.enabled: true` for every backend except Megatron) and enable the async engine (SC drives rollout via `RolloutManager.generate_and_push`, which is only supported on the disaggregated async engine):

    ```yaml
    policy:
      generation:
        backend: "vllm"
        vllm_cfg:
          async_engine: true
        colocated:
          enabled: false
          resources:
            num_nodes: 1
            gpus_per_node: 4  # inference GPUs; remainder go to training
    ```

    Megatron generation is also supported, colocated or non-colocated. It requires the Megatron trainer (`policy.megatron_cfg.enabled: true`) and NeMo-Gym rollouts additionally require `policy.generation.mcore_generation_config.expose_http_server: true`. Colocated (`colocated.enabled: true`) additionally requires `async_rl.min_groups_for_streaming_train == num_prompts_per_step`: the engine stands down for the whole train step, so each step must be assembled as one full batch before training takes the GPUs. Per-request deadlines (`generation_timeout_s`, `rollout_timeout_s`) exclude the time the engine is stood down: in-flight requests freeze with their clocks suspended, and the clocks resume on the post-step wake.
    The non-colocated exemplar — a NeMo-Gym run with the OpenAI server exposed — lives at [examples/nemo_gym/grpo_qwen3_0_6b_megatron_generation_single_controller.yaml](../../examples/nemo_gym/grpo_qwen3_0_6b_megatron_generation_single_controller.yaml); the colocated exemplar at [examples/configs/grpo_math_1B_megatron_generation_colocated_single_controller.yaml](../../examples/configs/grpo_math_1B_megatron_generation_colocated_single_controller.yaml):

    ```yaml
    policy:
      megatron_cfg:
        enabled: true
      generation:
        backend: "megatron"
        mcore_generation_config:
          expose_http_server: true  # required for NeMo-Gym rollouts
        colocated:
          enabled: false  # set true for colocated (no resources split needed)
          resources:
            num_nodes: 1
            gpus_per_node: 1  # inference GPUs; remainder go to training
    ```

    For default non-colocated vLLM refit, the SingleController entrypoint uses the
    same vLLM generation path as legacy GRPO/PPO, so you can opt into vLLM's
    native reload API with:

    ```yaml
    policy:
      generation:
        backend: "vllm"
        refit_transport: null
        colocated:
          enabled: false
        vllm_cfg:
          async_engine: true
          refit_with_reload_api: true
    ```

    This reload API path has the same limitations described in [Weight Refit](./refit.md#vllm-reload-api); for LoRA runs you can additionally stream only the adapter factors, see [adapter-only payload](./refit.md#adapter-only-payload).

3. **One RL step = one training batch.** The batch a step trains on is the whole step (see `validate_single_controller_config` in [nemo_rl/algorithms/single_controller_utils/config.py](../../nemo_rl/algorithms/single_controller_utils/config.py)). A GRPO step is also one optimizer step. A PPO step applies `ppo.ppo_epochs` actor updates and `ppo.critic_ppo_epochs` critic updates over that same batch. Both counts must be at least 1 and can be configured independently; the exemplar defaults the critic count to `${ppo.ppo_epochs}`.

    ```python
    num_prompts_per_step * num_generations_per_prompt == policy.train_global_batch_size
    num_prompts_per_step * num_generations_per_prompt == value.train_global_batch_size  # PPO
    ```

4. **Enable importance sampling correction** whenever the sampler admits off-policy data (any `max_staleness_versions > 0` on the `windowed`/`weight_fifo` samplers, or `max_lookahead_versions > 0` on `in_order`). The correction and its derivation are the same as for legacy async GRPO — see [Why Importance Sampling Correction Is Required for Async](./async-grpo.md#why-importance-sampling-correction-is-required-for-async):

    ```yaml
    loss_fn:
      use_importance_sampling_correction: true
    ```

5. **Save the data plane for replay recovery.** When Single-Controller checkpointing is enabled, all built-in samplers require `checkpointing.save_data_plane: true` so completed, unconsumed rollout groups survive a restart. Native TQ checkpointing supports both `simple` and `mooncake_cpu` through these same checkpoint settings; no backend-specific switch is needed. For multi-node runs, `checkpoint_dir` must be on a durable filesystem visible at the same path from every node.

    ```yaml
    checkpointing:
      enabled: true
      checkpoint_dir: /shared/checkpoints/my-run
      save_data_plane: true

    data_plane:
      enabled: true
      backend: "simple"
    ```

6. **(PPO) Set `ppo:` instead of `grpo:`** — the two algorithm blocks are mutually exclusive, and SC reads every step setting from whichever one is present. A PPO run also needs `value:`, `value_loss_fn:` and `ppo.adv_estimator.name: gae` (same schemas as legacy PPO), a Megatron critic, and `policy.offload_optimizer_for_logprob: true`, which is what keeps the policy optimizer off the GPU while the critic runs. `ppo.policy_training_start_step: N` gives the usual critic warmup: for the first N steps the policy is neither trained nor refit, while the critic trains every step. `ppo.warm_start_value_checkpoint` seeds that critic from another run's checkpoint instead, so a fresh run can skip the online warmup entirely — see [Warm-Starting the Critic](./ppo.md#warm-starting-the-critic).

## Checkpointing and Replay Recovery

With `checkpointing.save_data_plane: true`, each Single-Controller checkpoint contains:

- The normal model, dataloader, and controller state, plus optimizer state when configured.
- A native TQ snapshot containing rollout tensor payloads and TQ state.
- A metadata-only replay index describing the completed rollout groups stored in TQ.
- A `rollout_recovery.pt` ownership ledger describing unfinished prompt groups that must be redispatched after a restart.
- A `replacement_reserve.pt` sidecar containing prompts held for dropped-rollout replacement, when applicable.
- The sampler dispatch position needed to continue scheduling from the correct point.

The TQ snapshot and replay index are captured under the same checkpoint barrier. Generation may continue while the snapshot is written, but completed-group commits and destructive TQ clears wait at the barrier. This ensures that the TQ snapshot and replay index describe the same set of groups.

On resume, Single-Controller validates the TQ snapshot against the trainer checkpoint, restores the replay index, and makes completed, committed, unconsumed groups available to the sampler before training resumes.

Replay recovery is supported by all built-in samplers: `in_order`, `weight_fifo`, `ready_first`, and `windowed`. Custom samplers must explicitly declare `supports_buffer_checkpoint = True`. Otherwise, setup emits a warning and completed buffered groups are not restored.

### Periodic rollout snapshots

Normal trainer checkpoints are written at step boundaries. Periodic rollout
snapshots preserve newer rollout progress between those trainer checkpoints,
including while the train pump is accumulating a streamed step:

```yaml
checkpointing:
  enabled: true
  checkpoint_dir: /shared/checkpoints/my-run
  save_data_plane: true
  save_period: 1

rollout_checkpointing:
  snapshot_attempt_interval_s: 120
  telemetry_interval_s: null
  max_consecutive_failures: 3
  keep_latest_k: 2
  restore_mode: latest
  extra_fingerprint_excluded_paths: []

token_capture:
  enabled: true
```

`snapshot_attempt_interval_s` is the cadence at which Single-Controller attempts
a rollout snapshot. It is not a guarantee that a snapshot is written at every
interval. An attempt after step N succeeds only when the immutable trainer
checkpoint `step_N` is already durable. Consequently, `save_period: 1` is
recommended for continuous post-step coverage; with a larger value, attempts
are skipped until the matching trainer checkpoint exists. Before the first
training step, snapshots are anchored to the initial model and a fingerprint of
the rollout-semantic configuration.

`telemetry_interval_s` controls an independent wall-clock sampler for rollout
throughput and checkpoint pressure. It is `null` (disabled) by default; set it
to a positive number such as `30` to emit one sample every 30 seconds. This does
not change the checkpoint cadence. See the
[Single-Controller rollout recovery metrics](../observability/metrics.md#single-controller-rollout-recovery-metrics)
for the emitted fields.

`max_consecutive_failures` is the number of consecutive retryable periodic-save
failures tolerated before training aborts. A successful or skipped checkpoint
attempt resets the count; checkpoint invariant failures still fail immediately.

The bootstrap fingerprint is fail-closed: every configuration value affects
compatibility unless NeMo-RL's built-in denylist identifies it as operational,
such as logging, cluster placement, checkpoint location, runtime ports, or
credentials. This means configuration added by an external algorithm is safe
by default—a change prevents bootstrap recovery instead of silently mixing
incompatible rollout state.
The bootstrap manifest also stores this credential-redacted compatibility
identity so a rejected restart can report the exact changed dotpaths instead of
showing only two opaque digests.

An integration may use `extra_fingerprint_excluded_paths` for additional
runtime-only values that are not part of NeMo-RL's built-in configuration:

```yaml
rollout_checkpointing:
  extra_fingerprint_excluded_paths:
    - custom_algo.observability
    - env.private_agent.runtime_endpoint
    - env.private_agent.workers.*.log_dir
```

Each dotpath removes that value and its children from the compatibility
identity. `*` matches one mapping or list level and `**` matches any number of
levels.
Only exclude values that cannot affect prompts, generation, rewards, lineage,
or the interpretation of persisted rollout data. These exclusions must be set
on the original run as well as its restart.

Periodic snapshots currently require all of the following:

- `checkpointing.enabled: true` and `checkpointing.save_data_plane: true`.
- `data_plane.backend: simple` or `data_plane.backend: mooncake_cpu`, because native TQ save/load is required.
- `token_capture.enabled: true`.
- A replay-recoverable sampler with training-claim ownership. All built-in
  samplers qualify. A custom sampler must explicitly declare both
  `supports_buffer_checkpoint = True` and `supports_training_claims = True`.

With `data_plane.backend: mooncake_cpu`, data-plane checkpointing also requires
`async_rl.generation_fleet_health.restart_dead_shards: false`. Setup rejects
automatic shard restarts because replacing a generation worker can discard
its owned Mooncake payload and leave stale checkpoint worker handles. This
restriction applies to both trainer-step checkpoints and periodic rollout
snapshots; restarting the whole job from a saved checkpoint is still supported.
Support for live shard restarts is tracked in
[NVIDIA-NeMo/RL#4178](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/issues/4178).

Each trainer or bootstrap anchor has a `rollout_snapshots/` directory. A
published `snapshot_NNNNNN/` contains the native TQ snapshot and matching
replay, dataloader, controller, replacement-reserve, and unfinished-rollout
metadata. `keep_latest_k` retains recent committed snapshots as fallbacks;
temporary or interrupted directories are never selected for recovery.

With `restore_mode: latest`, startup selects the newest compatible committed
snapshot under the latest trainer anchor. With `trainer_checkpoint`, it ignores
newer periodic rollout progress and resumes from the trainer checkpoint bundle.
Checkpoint selection is read-only: neither mode removes snapshots. If no trainer
checkpoint exists, `trainer_checkpoint` cannot safely reuse an existing bootstrap
namespace, so startup fails without modifying it. Recover that state with `latest`
or choose a new `checkpoint_dir` to start a fresh bootstrap lineage. Obsolete
bootstrap snapshots are removed only by retention after a durable trainer
checkpoint exists.

> **Bootstrap-only `trainer_checkpoint` behavior:** A bootstrap rollout snapshot
> has no corresponding model or optimizer checkpoint. Therefore
> `restore_mode: trainer_checkpoint` deliberately fails when bootstrap state exists
> but no trainer checkpoint does. It does not ignore or delete that state. Use
> `latest` to recover it, or select a new `checkpoint_dir` to start from scratch.

:::{note}
Completed groups are restored directly from the TQ snapshot. For unfinished
token-capture groups, `rollout_recovery.default_granularity` controls both live
failure and restart behavior:

- `sibling` preserves each sealed sibling and redispatches only unfinished ones.
- `prompt_group` retries every sibling in the group when any sibling is unfinished.

`sibling` is the default and avoids regenerating completed work. Use
`prompt_group` when every generation in a recovered group must come from the
policy weights live at redispatch.

`task_source_granularity_overrides` can select the policy using the Gym
`task_source` embedded in the raw rollout row. Unlike `agent_ref`, this identity
is available before Gym resolves the concrete agent and SC reserves the recovery
group. When a row already carries an `agent_ref`, a matching
`agent_granularity_overrides` entry wins over a matching task-source entry,
mirroring Gym's concrete-route precedence. Otherwise the task-source override,
then the global default, applies. The agent map also keeps datasets collated
before Gym recorded `task_source` working, although re-collating them is
recommended. Non-default policies require `token_capture.enabled: true`. The
task source and resolved policy are persisted in `rollout_recovery.pt`, so
recovery does not reinterpret an existing group using changed configuration. A
generation that already finished keeps its tokens in the token-capture staging
area, so `sibling` reuses them unchanged; a redispatched sibling produces a new
sample from the same prompt. Neither becomes a training row until every
generation in the group has finished.
:::

When a sampler does not support replay recovery, a requested data-plane checkpoint is written in `shadow` mode. The TQ snapshot is retained, but no authoritative replay index is written and its rows are not restored into the training replay buffer.

Native TQ save/load works with both `data_plane.backend: "simple"` and `data_plane.backend: "mooncake_cpu"`, using the existing `checkpointing.enabled: true` and `checkpointing.save_data_plane: true` settings. A failure while saving or validating the TQ snapshot prevents the incomplete checkpoint bundle from becoming the latest resumable checkpoint.

## Async-RL Knobs and Sampler Modes

All SC async-RL runtime knobs live under `async_rl:` in the master config. The most important choice is the `sampler`, which sets the staleness policy shared by the rollout pump (how far it may run ahead) and the train pump (which groups it may consume).

### Sampler modes

Pick one of five modes with `sampler.name`. Each mode takes its own knobs, listed below — a knob from one mode has no effect under another:

![Sampler modes: same buffer, four different training batches](../assets/sc-sampler-modes.png)

*Same buffer under trainer weight 2 (`num_prompts_per_step=2`, staleness window `[0, 2]`). `windowed` and `weight_fifo` select on `start_weight` (stamped at dispatch); `in_order` selects on `target_step` (stamped at admit). The three usually pick the same groups and diverge only when rollouts finish out of order, as drawn here.*


| `sampler.name` | Rollout gating                                                                                                          | Train selection                                                                                                   | Typical use                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `in_order`     | Dispatch may lead the trainer by up to `max_lookahead_versions` batches. Each dispatch is stamped with a `target_step`. | Consume the group whose `target_step == current_train_weight`.                                                    | Sync mode (`max_lookahead_versions=0`) and legacy-async exact-batch semantics (`max_lookahead_versions>=1`). |
| `weight_fifo`  | Same gate as `in_order` (`max_staleness_versions` of lookahead).                                                        | Drain the oldest in-window `start_weight` first, waiting for that weight's batch to fill.                         | Strict weight-version FIFO under a bounded lookahead.                                                        |
| `ready_first`  | Same gate as `weight_fifo` (`max_staleness_versions` of lookahead).                                                     | Take any ready group generated by a policy version no newer than the trainer, including late stragglers.         | Completion-order streaming without stale-group eviction.                                                    |
| `windowed`     | Ungated — rollout keeps producing until the buffer fills.                                                               | Take any ready group with `start_weight` in `[train - max_staleness_versions, train]`, optionally freshest-first. | Over-sampled streaming; aged groups outside the window are evicted (wasted compute).                         |
| `custom`       | Determined by the imported class.                                                                                       | Determined by the imported class.                                                                                 | `target: "module:ClassName"` — bring your own `PromptGroupSampler`.                                          |


PPO supports `in_order` and `ready_first`, both with full-step batches. For `ready_first`, set `loss_fn.use_importance_sampling_correction: true` and `loss_fn.force_on_policy_ratio: false`; its `max_staleness_versions` controls admission lookahead, while already-admitted rollouts remain selectable.

### Config → behavior map

The shipped exemplars cover three of the five modes:


| Mode                             | `sampler.name` | Sampler knob                   | `min_groups_for_streaming_train` | `max_buffered_rollouts`                               | Exemplar |

| Streaming, over-sampled          | `windowed`     | `max_staleness_versions: >= 1` | `x <= num_prompts_per_step`      | Larger than the gated capacity (dispatch is ungated)  | [`grpo-llama3.1-8b-instruct-2n8g-async-1off-single-controller-streaming2.yaml`](../../examples/configs/recipes/llm/grpo-llama3.1-8b-instruct-2n8g-async-1off-single-controller-streaming2.yaml) |


Field definitions:

- `max_buffered_rollouts` — hard cap on unconsumed rollout groups buffered in the data plane. Validated at setup against the gated sampler's required capacity; a value too small deadlocks the rollout pump, so setup raises instead of silently blocking. Sized from the widest window the run ever uses, so `warmup_lookahead_versions` rather than `max_lookahead_versions` when it is set.
- `min_groups_for_streaming_train` — minimum ready groups the trainer waits for before dispatching a batch. Set to `num_prompts_per_step` for sync/legacy semantics; lower for streaming. (PPO) Must equal `num_prompts_per_step` — the critic has no split train API, so each critic epoch calls the full-step `train_from_meta` once per chunk. Splitting an RL step across chunks would multiply both models' configured optimizer updates by the number of chunks.
- `sampler.warmup_lookahead_versions` (PPO, `in_order` only) — lookahead used while `ppo.policy_training_start_step` critic warmup is in progress, shrinking back to `max_lookahead_versions` afterwards. The SC equivalent of `ppo.async_ppo.warmup_generation_lead_steps`.
- `num_advantage_workers` — CPU Ray actors that run the advantage stage. `0` (the default) keeps it in the controller process, which is correct but both holds a whole cohort's advantage inputs in the controller's heap and blocks the controller's event loop for the duration of the computation — long enough at Ultra scale to miss Ray's actor liveness ping. A positive value moves both costs onto dedicated actors, placed off the dedicated Ray head so their host-memory peak does not land beside the controller. Only `grpo` and `opd` are sharded across the pool: every other `adv_estimator` also reduces over the whole batch, which a shard is not, so those run as one call on one actor and a larger pool buys them nothing. Each stage logs `advantage stage: N row(s) over M shard(s), pool=P` with the reason whenever `M` is 1. Under `data_plane.backend: mooncake_cpu` each actor is its own TransferQueue client and mounts a full `global_segment_size + local_buffer_size`, like each token-capture finalizer, so budget it on top of `gpus_per_node × (segment + buffer)`.
- `log_full_train_data` — writes every consumed sample to `train_data_step<N>.jsonl` in the log dir. The advantage stage is what holds the untruncated tensors, so the stage writes the dump wherever it runs: with a pool each shard writes its own `train_data_step<N>.jsonl.part-<shard>` and the controller merges them in shard order on a completed optimizer step, assigning `idx` across the merged file. That requires the pool to share a filesystem with the controller: the log dir was controller-only before this, so a node-local one worked and now would not. The controller checks the merged row count against what the shards reported and fails the step rather than publishing a dump that is short a shard. The JSON serialization is the expensive part and scales with batch size × sequence length, so a pool also moves that cost off the controller; it is reported back per call and still shows up under the `train_data_dump` timer. Debug-only — leave it `false` for production runs.

## Implementation Structure

The SC path splits the async-GRPO loop across a rollout pump and a train pump that share a `TQReplayBuffer` and are orchestrated by the `SingleControllerActor`.

![SC ownership and call model: driver, SingleControllerActor, and remote worker groups](../assets/sc-ownership.png)

*The driver builds every heavy object and cloudpickles it into `SingleControllerActor` (a CPU-only Ray actor). `TQReplayBuffer`, `RolloutManager`, and the sampler live inside that actor — reaching them is a direct call, not RPC. Only the generation worker group, `TQPolicy`, and the TransferQueue data plane are separate processes; the dashed arrows are the only hops that cross a process boundary.*

### Core components

#### 1. `SingleControllerActor` (`nemo_rl/algorithms/single_controller.py`)

- Single Ray actor that runs `_rollout_pump` and `_train_pump` concurrently as asyncio tasks.
- Receives a fully-constructed `SingleControllerActorArgs` (cloudpickled by the driver) — the actor does no construction work of its own, because running setup inside a nested Ray actor breaks `runtime_env` resolution. Exception: `Logger` is built inside the actor, because wandb/TB backends hold a `_thread.lock` that cloudpickle can't serialize.
- On startup, rebinds `self._rollout_manager._tq_buffer = self._buffer`. `rollout_manager` and `tq_buffer` are separate fields on the args dataclass, so Ray deserializes them as two independent buffers; without the rebind, the writer and the sampler would see different copies and the sampler would never observe committed groups.
- Pump crashes propagate to the driver; in-flight rollouts drain on exit.

#### 2. `TQReplayBuffer` (`nemo_rl/algorithms/async_utils/replay_buffer.py`)

- Group-granular replay buffer with reserve/commit slot accounting.
- `start_weight` is stamped on the slot at `reserve` (dispatch); `commit` tensorizes the group into N training-shaped rows, records `end_weight`, and flips the slot ready. Because slots are appended at reserve, buffer index order equals dispatch order and `start_weight` only ever increases down the buffer — which is why `windowed` and `weight_fifo` usually pick the same groups and diverge only when rollouts finish out of order.
- Tracks `target_step` per group when the sampler assigns one at admit time (used by `in_order`).

#### 3. `RolloutManager.generate_and_push` (`nemo_rl/experience/rollout_manager.py`)

- One entry point per prompt group: reserve a buffer slot, drive the rollout via `AsyncRolloutImpl` or `AsyncNemoGymRolloutImpl`, and commit with the observed weight versions.
- `env_handles` provide per-task environments to the rollout implementations.

#### 4. Samplers (`nemo_rl/algorithms/async_utils/staleness_sampler.py`)

- Filter-only prompt-group selector over `TQReplayBuffer`. The base `PromptGroupSampler` protocol defines `admit`, `select`, and `evict`.
- `WindowedSampler`, `ReadyFirstSampler`, `WeightFifoSampler`, and `InOrderSampler` are the built-in policies (one per row in the [Sampler modes](#sampler-modes) table). The `custom` mode (`CustomSamplerConfig.target`) makes `create_sampler` import a user-supplied class by FQN and type-check it against `PromptGroupSampler`.

#### 5. `_rollout_pump` and `_train_pump`

- `_rollout_pump`: pulls prompts from the dataloader, calls `sampler.admit`, dispatches `RolloutManager.generate_and_push`, and honours `max_inflight_prompts` as a backpressure cap.
- `_train_pump`: `sampler.evict → sampler.select → _value_stage (PPO only) → _advantage_stage → _value_train_epochs (PPO only) → TQPolicy split API (begin_train_step / train_microbatches_from_meta / finish_train_step) → dp_client.clear_samples`.

### Coordination Flow

1. **Driver setup**: `setup_single_controller` builds the worker groups, virtual cluster, dp client, dataloader, `TQReplayBuffer`, `RolloutManager`, and weight synchronizer, and packs them into a `SingleControllerActorArgs` that the entrypoint cloudpickles into the actor.
2. **Actor startup**: `SingleControllerActor` launches `_rollout_pump` and `_train_pump` concurrently as asyncio tasks; both share the same `TQReplayBuffer` and `StalenessSampler`.
3. **Rollout pump loop**: `sampler.admit` gates dispatch against the current trainer version (returning a `target_step` for `in_order`); the pump then reserves a buffer slot, drives `RolloutManager.generate_and_push`, and commits with the observed `start_weight` / `end_weight`.
4. **Train pump loop**: `sampler.evict` drops out-of-window groups and `sampler.select` picks the next batch. On PPO, `_value_stage` runs the critic forward, `_advantage_stage` computes advantages, and `_value_train_epochs` runs `ppo.critic_ppo_epochs` critic updates. The TQPolicy split API then runs one optimizer step per RL step on GRPO, or `ppo.ppo_epochs` policy updates on PPO.
5. **Weight sync**: after each optimizer step the pump bumps the trainer version, clears rollout permission, calls the weight synchronizer, and re-opens the rollout pump for the next version.

## Relation to Legacy Async GRPO

The [legacy async GRPO](./async-grpo.md) (`grpo.async_grpo.enabled: true` under `run_grpo.py`) and the SC path both target the same async training problem but partition responsibilities differently:


|                  | Legacy async GRPO                        | Single-Controller                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Entrypoint       | `run_grpo.py`                            | `run_grpo_single_controller.py`                                                      |
| Data-plane       | Direct actor RPC                         | TransferQueue (`data_plane.enabled: true` required)                                  |
| Rollout batching | Full-batch `AsyncTrajectoryCollector`    | Per-prompt `RolloutManager.generate_and_push` into a group-granular `TQReplayBuffer` |
| Staleness policy | Single knob (`max_trajectory_age_steps`) | Pluggable `StalenessSampler` (`in_order` / `weight_fifo` / `ready_first` / `windowed` / `custom`) |
| Batch boundary   | Sampled by target weight                 | Sampler-defined; can decouple rollout dispatch from train batch (streaming)          |


### Migrating a legacy async config

SC reads its async knobs from `async_rl:` and **requires `grpo.async_grpo: null`** (or `ppo.async_ppo: null` on a PPO run) — `run_grpo_single_controller.py` raises if a legacy block is still present, so null it out when porting rather than leaving it in place.

Do not carry `max_num_epochs: -1` across either. [ppo.md](./ppo.md#asynchronous-ppo) requires that value for legacy async PPO, but SC has no `-1` convention: the rollout pump gates on `_current_epoch < max_num_epochs`, so any non-positive value trains zero steps and exits successfully. Setup rejects it — set a positive `max_num_epochs` and bound the run with `max_num_steps`.

| Legacy `grpo.async_grpo.*` / `ppo.async_ppo.*` | SC equivalent `async_rl.*` |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `enabled: true` | Implicit — SC is always async; use `sampler.max_lookahead_versions: 0` for sync semantics, `>= 1` for async |
| `max_trajectory_age_steps: N` | `sampler.name: in_order` with `sampler.max_lookahead_versions: N` |
| `warmup_generation_lead_steps` (PPO) | `sampler.warmup_lookahead_versions` — the lookahead to use while critic warmup is in progress |
| `recompute_kv_cache_after_weight_updates` | `recompute_kv_cache_after_weight_updates` (same) |
| `in_flight_weight_updates` | Always effectively true; `false`-equivalent behavior is not yet supported (drain-gate tracked in [issue #2625](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/issues/2625)) |
| *(no legacy equivalent — matches legacy full-batch train semantics)* | `min_groups_for_streaming_train: ${grpo.num_prompts_per_step}`, or `${ppo.num_prompts_per_step}` on a PPO run |
| *(no legacy equivalent — matches legacy `max_trajectory_age + 1` batches in flight)* | `max_inflight_prompts: num_prompts_per_step × (max_lookahead_versions + 1)` |
| *(no legacy equivalent — legacy sizes its buffer to `num_prompts_per_step × max_trajectory_age_steps × 2`)* | `max_buffered_rollouts: num_prompts_per_step × (max_lookahead_versions + 1)` (tight; see the [Config → behavior map](#config--behavior-map) for per-sampler values) |

## Known Missing Features

The SC path is still under active development. Feature gaps are tracked in [issue #2625](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/issues/2625). Notable items:

- Multimodal/VLM GRPO is supported with Megatron generation. Set
  `policy.is_vlm: true`; see the
  [CLEVR Single-Controller recipe](../../examples/configs/recipes/vlm/vlm_grpo-nemotron-omni-30ba3b-clevr-8n4g-megatron-single-controller-async.v1.yaml).
- NeMo-Gym token capture also supports Omni dynamic-resolution images and native video
  rollouts with async vLLM generation and a Megatron learner. With
  `token_capture.enabled: true` and the VLM processor configured, workers capture
  the processed media used for inference together with each call's token delta.
  RL hands the owned tensors (`imgs`, `imgs_sizes`, and optional `num_frames`)
  to Gym's `complete_call_from_response` as opaque attachments, and the TQ sink
  writes them in the same `put` as the token columns, so `staged` coordinates
  acknowledge tokens and pixels together and a failed write is `capture_failed`
  at call time. Tensors keep their native shapes and dtypes on the wire; two
  per-row flags (`media_present`, `media_has_frames`) mark which rows carry
  pixels and whether they are video. Media-enabled staging partitions carry
  these columns on every row; text-only runs register and read none of them.
  vLLM pixels are rearranged losslessly into packed patches; the finalizer
  reads the presence flags with the base columns, then issues one batched read
  of the tensor columns for the terminal-chain calls that carry media, and
  publishes `pixel_values`, `imgs_sizes`, and `num_frames` for the existing
  Megatron learner without resampling or normalizing the media again.
  Only newly introduced occurrences are staged. vLLM-specific `media_spans`
  extras retain placeholder positions and token hashes for multi-turn prefix
  replacement, including video's timestamp-separated visual-token spans.
  Capture requests use vLLM's `skip_mm_cache=True` path to obtain concrete
  processor tensors. vLLM can still reuse its processor-only cache; this does
  not guarantee fresh preprocessing. vLLM tiles images from a dummy prompt, so
  the request text never changes geometry, but the images of one request share
  the token budget: adding an image under a tight budget can re-tile a retained
  one, and a warm processor-only cache can keep a geometry a fresh processor
  would not reproduce. If that changes retained geometry or placeholder tokens, the worker
  rejects the continuation before inference with HTTP 400 and error code
  `retained_media_changed` (other capture-time validation failures use
  `media_capture_rejected`). Gym's current exception middleware wraps the
  upstream error in HTTP 500, retaining the code in the response body. RL then
  classifies it as an infrastructure `GymTransportError`, eligible for the
  configured prompt retry policy; it is not a dedicated terminal rejection.
  Text-call rows carry sentinels in each column's own dtype, because
  TransferQueue keeps one dtype per field across live rows.
  Media-enabled rows also store `media_metadata_digest`, a SHA-256 checksum of
  the small route-less extras JSON. Sources check it before exposing media
  descriptors, without reading pixels or routed-expert tensors. Missing or
  changed checksums reject the row. This detects accidental metadata corruption;
  it is independent of Gym's receipt and combined `extras_digest` commitment.
  Media bundles are structurally validated before writing and after reading
  (required tensors, patch geometry, frame grouping); malformed or missing
  columns reject the rollout as `invalid_media_columns`, incompatible parts
  along a chain as `media_chain_incompatible`. Tensor contents are not hashed;
  retained occurrences are checked by geometry and placeholder tokens. Media
  must remain immutable for the rollout's lifetime and preprocessing must be
  deterministic. Same-shape pixel changes and corruption of stored pixel values
  are outside this check's coverage. Call
  rows share the existing checkpoint and cleanup lifecycle. TQ has no
  transactional rollback: a failed combined write is discarded best-effort by
  the sink, and a failed discard is logged at ERROR.
  Upgrade the paired Gym and RL changes together. The GB200 functional shard
  `L1_Functional_Tests_GB200_Vllm_Omni_Single_Controller.sh` smokes this path
  end to end (CLEVR-style images through Gym `string_match`, native video
  through Gym `mcqa`) and gates on `train/finalize/media_row_rate == 1`, the
  metric that reports the fraction of learner rows built from captured media.
  Media capture requires `policy.generation.backend: vllm`; Megatron inference
  token capture is text-only. No new Megatron-LM pin is needed. Compaction,
  mixed image/video conversations, native audio,
  video token pruning, static tiling (`image_num_patches`), other processor families,
  and `token_capture.defer_routed_experts_to_policy: true` are not supported.
- Multi-Teacher On-Policy Distillation (MOPD) is supported for text-only NeMo
  Gym rollouts; multimodal/VLM MOPD is not yet supported. See
  [Multi-Teacher On-Policy Distillation](../about/algorithms/mopd.md#running-mopd).
- Train backend: only Megatron is supported and validated; the AutoModel training path has not been tested on SC.
- Generation backend: vLLM and Megatron generation are supported (Megatron in both non-colocated and colocated modes); SGLang and TRT-LLM have not been tested on SC.
- Validation is not yet supported (setup raises on `val_period > 0`, `val_at_start`, or `val_at_end`); checkpointing is.
- (PPO) Rollout drop budgets — `async_rl.rollout_failure.max_skipped_prompts` and `max_consecutive_dropped_prompts` must both be `0`. A drop shortens the step, and the critic shards it against the configured `value.train_global_batch_size` rather than its actual size, so setup rejects a non-zero budget. The resiliency layer stays available on GRPO.
- Reward shaping and sample filtering — `reward_shaping`, `reward_scaling`, and `use_dynamic_sampling` are implemented on neither algorithm block, so setup rejects them rather than silently skipping the shaping. Environment-flagged sample masking and `overlong_filtering` are supported; truncated completions are excluded from the loss through `sample_mask`, and a step in which every completion is filtered is rejected rather than skipped.
- The `windowed` sampler has no `over_sampling_ratio` cap — over-produced groups aged past the window are evicted, wasting rollout compute.
- The drain gate in refit is not yet supported.

### Full training-data dumps

Set `async_rl.log_full_train_data: true` to stream every consumed sample to
`train_data_step<N>.jsonl` in the logger directory. This is independent of
`env.should_log_nemo_gym_responses` and OPD diagnostics. Dumps retain masked
samples and include full token IDs, token/sample loss masks, final clipped
advantages, rewards, sample IDs and metadata, generation logprobs, and the
student/teacher logprobs when computed. Only padding beyond `input_lengths`
is removed; response content is not capped. Values follow the legacy
singleton-batch JSONL shape. Chunks stream through `.jsonl.partial` files;
the final name is published only after the optimizer step completes. A
partial file is not proof of a completed training step.

The per-step `timing/train/train_data_dump` metric reports wall-clock seconds
summed across chunk preparation/writes and final-file publication. Chunk dump
time is also included in `advantage_calculation`; these timings overlap.
