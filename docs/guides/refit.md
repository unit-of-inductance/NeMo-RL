# Weight Refit: Choosing a Transport

Weight refit copies updated policy weights into the rollout model. Choose the
topology first, then select one transport with
`policy.generation.refit_transport`.

## Pick a Transport

| Topology | `refit_transport` | Transport | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `colocated.enabled: true` | `null` | CUDA IPC | Policy and rollout workers share GPUs; vLLM uses ZMQ plus CUDA IPC handles and SGLang uses Ray CUDA IPC. |
| `colocated.enabled: true` | `mcore` | MCore wake-reshard | Megatron policy and generation share GPUs. |
| `colocated.enabled: false` | `null` | NCCL broadcast | vLLM and Megatron use the default full-weight collective; SGLang uses its own weight-update group. |
| `colocated.enabled: false` | `mcore` | MCore native refit | Megatron policy sends directly to Megatron generation through an MCore copy service. |
| `colocated.enabled: false` | `nccl_reshard` | NCCL reshard | Provides the best performance for large models (>100s B models). |
| `colocated.enabled: false` | `vllm_zmq_sparse` | Sparse delta over ZeroMQ | The link is bandwidth-limited and workers can reach a relay over TCP. |
| `colocated.enabled: false` | `vllm_s3_sparse` | Sparse delta through S3 | Workers communicate through shared object storage. |
| `colocated.enabled: false` | `nixl` | NIXL checkpoint engine | The cluster has a fast UCX/RDMA fabric for full-weight refit. |

`null` is the default. For non-colocated Megatron generation it selects the
packed collective; Megatron's native refit must be selected explicitly with
`mcore`. The sparse transports read only `refit_cfg.sparse`; NIXL reads only
`refit_cfg.nixl`. Because one selector chooses the transport, sparse delta and
NIXL cannot both be active.

## vLLM Reload API

For non-colocated vLLM using the default NCCL transport, set
`policy.generation.vllm_cfg.refit_with_reload_api: true` to install refitted
weights through vLLM's native `reload_weights` API. The flag is off by default.
Use this path when vLLM's post-load processing is required after every refit,
for example `flashinfer_trtllm` MoE models where `process_weights_after_loading`
reshapes expert weight buffers.

Early measurements from this PR show that reload refit can be faster for Llama
8B and Qwen3 32B, while Qwen3 30B-A3B was about 44% slower. MXFP8 reload refit
was about 2x slower in the measured run and used higher peak memory. Leave
additional KV-cache headroom for MXFP8, for example by lowering
`policy.generation.vllm_cfg.gpu_memory_utilization`.

The reload API path currently supports only `policy.generation.backend: vllm`,
`policy.generation.colocated.enabled: false`, and
`policy.generation.refit_transport: null`. It is explicitly unsupported with
`nccl_reshard`, ModelOpt quantization (`policy.generation.quant_cfg`), sparse
refit transports, and checkpoint-engine/NIXL transports. Eagle/MTP draft
weights refitted from the trainer are not supported yet; use the legacy loader
for those cases.

## Adapter-Only Payload

The default refit payload merges LoRA factors into the base weights on the
trainer and ships the full model. For LoRA runs this repeats a lot of frozen
work every step. `refit_payload_mode: adapter_delta` streams only the LoRA
`lora_A`/`lora_B` factors instead, and the vLLM receiver merges them into its
live base weights in place with `base += (alpha / dim) * (B @ A)`. The merge
reproduces the trainer-side arithmetic, so the served weights match the
`hf_export` path.

Enable it when the per-step payload is too large to move within the refit
budget: a ~234 GiB full export for a large 512-expert MoE is the motivating
example from the design work. The adapter payload is the LoRA factors alone,
hundreds of MiB to a few GiB depending on the number of target modules and
the rank. The base model must be frozen, which LoRA training already
guarantees.

Set `refit_payload_mode` and leave `refit_transport: null`:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    colocated:
      enabled: false
    refit_transport: null
    vllm_cfg:
      refit_payload_mode: adapter_delta  # default hf_export, unchanged behavior
      refit_adapter_scaling: 2.0         # alpha / dim from megatron_cfg.peft
```

The adapter scaling is `alpha / dim` of the run's LoRA config. The receiver
refuses to merge with an assumed default. Both the legacy drivers and the
Single-Controller setup derive it from `policy.megatron_cfg.peft` at setup, so
there is normally nothing to set by hand; set it explicitly only in configs
that bypass those setup paths.

Constraints:

- Policy backend must be Megatron. The source side is Bridge's
  `export_adapter_weights`.
- Transport must be the collective, `refit_transport: null`. Other transports
  apply weights with overwrite semantics and would silently drop the
  `lora_A`/`lora_B` names. The config validation refuses them.

## Constraints

| Transport | Generation backend | Policy backend | Quantization and MoE |
|---|---|---|---|
| Colocated CUDA IPC | vLLM or SGLang | DTensor or Megatron | Uses the generation backend's standard loader. |
| NCCL | vLLM or Megatron | DTensor or Megatron | Uses the standard full-weight loader. |
| NCCL + reload API | vLLM | DTensor or Megatron | Default non-colocated NCCL only. Rejects colocated refit, `nccl_reshard`, sparse delta, NIXL/checkpoint-engine transports, ModelOpt quantization (`real_quant` or `quant_cfg`), and Eagle/MTP trainer-refit draft weights. |
| MCore native refit | Megatron | Megatron | Supports MCore's configured copy-service backend. |
| SGLang NCCL weight-update group | SGLang | Megatron | Trainer rank 0 broadcasts finalized HF tensors to the engine leaders. |
| NCCL reshard | vLLM or Megatron | Megatron | Supports BF16 and the documented FP8/MXFP8 combinations; see the [NCCL Reshard Refit design](../design-docs/nccl-reshard-refit.md). |
| Sparse delta | vLLM | Megatron | BF16/FP16, unquantized rollout only. |
| NIXL, full weights | vLLM | DTensor or Megatron | Supports the standard full-weight FP8 loader. DTensor FP8 KV-cache scale transfer is not yet supported. |
| NIXL, sharded experts | vLLM | DTensor or Megatron | Unquantized BF16/FP16 Triton MoE only; FP8/MXFP8 and dynamic expert placement are rejected. |

Non-colocated SGLang generation is supported with a Megatron policy and
`refit_transport: null`; it creates its own NCCL weight-update group. The NIXL
restrictions are on the generation backend; both Megatron and DTensor policy
workers can send weights. Sparse delta is currently limited to GRPO. NIXL is
initialized by the GRPO and distillation setup paths; PPO currently requires
colocated generation.

## Minimal Configuration

Colocated vLLM and SGLang refit need no transport configuration:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    colocated:
      enabled: true
    refit_transport: null
```

For non-colocated NCCL, change the topology and leave the selector unset:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    colocated:
      enabled: false
    refit_transport: null
```

For native MCore refit, select it explicitly:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    backend: megatron
    refit_transport: mcore
    mcore_generation_config:
      refit_backend: nccl  # gloo | nccl | nccl_m2n (nvshmem is broken; see #3646)
```

For NCCL reshard with Megatron policy training and vLLM generation:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    colocated:
      enabled: false
    refit_transport: nccl_reshard
```

For sparse delta, select one data plane and configure its scope:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    colocated:
      enabled: false
    refit_transport: vllm_zmq_sparse  # or vllm_s3_sparse
    refit_cfg:
      sparse:
        delta_compression:
          encoding: xor
        storage:
          s3_bucket: null  # required for vllm_s3_sparse
```

For NIXL, select the checkpoint engine and configure its scope:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    colocated:
      enabled: false
    refit_transport: nixl
    refit_cfg:
      nixl:
        update_weights_bucket_memory_ratio: 0.05
        device: cuda
        backend_name: UCX
        release_after_refit: false
        shard_expert_weights: false
```
