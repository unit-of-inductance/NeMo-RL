"""NCCL collective weight synchronizer for non-colocated deployments.

Handles weight transfer between policy and generation workers running on
separate GPU clusters using NCCL collective communication. The policy
broadcasts its weights, and generation workers receive them via the
established NCCL process group.

Lifecycle per sync:
  1. policy.broadcast_weights_for_collective()    -- send via NCCL
     generation.update_weights_from_collective()  -- receive via NCCL
  2. Verify transfer success

No offload/restore steps are needed since policy and generation run on
separate GPUs with dedicated memory.
